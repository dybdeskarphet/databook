# Databook

Learning data science through _Practical Statistics for Data Scientists_ (O’Reilly).

This repo includes my notes, code snippets, and small experiments following the book — all aimed at building a solid stats foundation for real-world data work.

## Structure

- `src/` — Jupyter notebooks for coding parts of the book
- `src/data/` — datasets used in examples (sources [below](#see-also))
- `src/notes/` — my notes as PDFs and [`rnote`](https://rnote.flxzt.net/) files
