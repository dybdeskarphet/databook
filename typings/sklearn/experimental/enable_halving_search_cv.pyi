"""Enables Successive Halving search-estimators

The API and results of these estimators might change without any deprecation
cycle.

Importing this file dynamically sets the
:class:`~sklearn.model_selection.HalvingRandomSearchCV` and
:class:`~sklearn.model_selection.HalvingGridSearchCV` as attributes of the
`model_selection` module::

    >>> # explicitly require this experimental feature
    >>> from sklearn.experimental import enable_halving_search_cv # noqa
    >>> # now you can import normally from model_selection
    >>> from sklearn.model_selection import HalvingRandomSearchCV
    >>> from sklearn.model_selection import HalvingGridSearchCV


The ``# noqa`` comment comment can be removed: it just tells linters like
flake8 to ignore the import, which appears as unused.
